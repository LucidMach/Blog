They say the best place to learn _football_ is on a _football field_,
likewise the best place to learn **web dev** is the **web**.
üòù

There are a lot of places on the web from where you can learn (for **_free_**).

1. YouTube
2. Udemy
3. DEV/Medium
4. Twitter (yes, a lot of people tweet about web devüòÇ)

But as a beginner, it's very likely that you'd prolly choose YouTube and since YouTube has **a hell lot of channels to choose from**, _finding a channel that has a style you really enjoy_ would play a major role in learning journey.

Here's a list of my fav channels(and soon enough even yours ü§û)

1. [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) :
   ![Net Ninja's Channel Page on YouTube](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ghbygqmfhlwbglct61t1.png)
   This is my go-to channel for literally anything web.
   Shaun has this tendency to **_super-simplify any concept_** to a form that literally a 5yo can understand.
   He has playlist on topics, in which he explains concepts as we build a project.
   However, Shaun likes to take his time so **_if you've some dead-lines to meet_**. This is definitely **not the right channel for the situation**.

2. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) :

   Brad Traversy is the **_OG web dev youtuber_**.
   A lot of people who make web dev tutorials on YouTube have claimed to have learnt from his videos.
   His videos have this **_natural style_** that makes it seem like you're **_learning from a actual teacher in person_**.
   He teaches you all the essentials (the **_20%_** with which you can get **_80% of the work_** done)

3. [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) :

   Kyle is an kinda like the best of both worlds from Net Ninja and Traversy Media.
   His goal as a YouTuber is "`simplifying the web, so you can build your dream projects sooner`" which he absolutely aces.
   His videos tend to be crisp and to the point, so if you **_want a fundamental understanding of concepts_** while **_killing your dead-lines, this is the best channel_** for the situation.

4. [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) :
   ![Dev Ed's Channel Page on YouTube](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h7a8tbbrp45lrd5tkcgu.png)
   This is the YouTuber I personally best relate to.
   His videos focus on showing you **_how to think_** (in terms of both **design** and **development**).
   His videos are absolutely delightful and fun to watch.
   He is the **_PewDiePie of Web Dev YouTube_**.

5. [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/user/99baddawg) :

   Ben has been an inspirational figure/role model to me.
   He **_builds real-projects_** that he deploys and monetizes right in front of us.
   He's also **_THE YouTuber to learn React.JS, graphQl and TypeScript_** from.
   His content is filled with wit and dark humor (kinda) and is absolutely fun to watch
