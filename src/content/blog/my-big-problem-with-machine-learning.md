ever since 2019, machine learning has been slowly gaining the spotlight and me being the starry eyed technology enthusiast i was (kinda like Hiro Hamada) i **tried jumping in twice**... both failed leaps of faith

as **someone obsessed with building stuff from scratch** [this blog is custom built by the way], i found it really hard to get into ML as
most resources out there were either

1. too **theory intense** (Andrew NG's Coursera Course is an example)
2. too much **framework** (tensorflow and sklearn API abstracted)

searching for _[ML algorithm] from scratch_ **usually got you across that hurdle**, ton of amazing resources out there on youtube by the way

# What does ML Refer To?

The big problem started when as I got decent with ML (Machine Learning).

let me first define ML to make more sense

> the ~science~ math of taking in real world info, converting it into numbers and then ~finding~ learning a pattern out of it

my problem wasn't with ML, but it with what people refered to as ML. **i didn't like** what people refered to **when they said ML**, more of what they **didn't refer to**

i didn't like that when people said machine learning, **they meant the cresent moon**... all the cool fun stuff hid under the `DEEP LEARNING` tag

1. ANNs
2. CNNs
3. RNNS
4. Transformers

and more... so here's my unofficial tags for everything in ML

in this blog i shall refer to everything in the **cresent moon** not as machine learning but as **shallow learning**

i don't like shallow learning... even though _**shallow learning** could be used to solve certain problems with greater efficiency and **lower computation**_
