all of this began when i started my masters degree

all of a sudden... i was in a new country, surrounded by new people and not a lot to do [ignoring all the assignments, classes and all the socialising you have to do to gain a life]

it had been an year since i last built something meaningful with my time. [i was either busy with work or just winding down with my friends from the PG i stayed in]

i wanted to work on a problem that hasn't been solved before despite having had many attempts, solely cuz that just ment a market existed... [i had previously worked in a robotics startup - and the market for consumer robots wasn't there yet]

## Search for a Problem

i was doing a masters degree in one of the most rigourous universities in australia... famous for it's intense assignment load on it's students

while i breezing my way through the course... not all my peers were

well i wasn't exactly a very productive dude... i just didn't procastinate

if i wanted to get something done... i'd work on it untill it was over [i had different issues... wanting to do "something"]

</center>

i spoke to some people and i kinda realised these some people wanted a proper todo app... they'd use pen and paper cuz most apps they used lacked some feature or the other

but the problem with pen and paper was people would forget that they maintained a todo list after a while/gap

## Arc#1 - The Ultimate ToDo App

i made a instagram reel around this and put up a story-asking people if they wanted a proper todo list app

results were about 50% of the people wanted a better todo app and the other 50% gave me replies like:

1. just use apple remainders
2. sticky notes >>>
3. have you tried microsoft tasks
4. google calender is the ultimate todo app n\*gga

most responses were super expected to me except the "google calender is the ultimate todo app n\*gga" so i got super curious on this went on a rabbit hole of understanding this response

even before i stated going down this rabbit hole... i had put a team together and so i started making wireframes for the app... multiple brainstorming sessions later we came up with these wireframes:

<center>

![wireframes](/public/how-we-built-the-app-what-will-make-you-more-productive/wireframes.jpg)

</center>

## Arc#2 - Rabbit Hole

i was reading / watching as much content as possible on how people use calanders cuz umm well it would boost my personal productivity

about this time was when i got into a student team on campus... and the team lead there - [Rohan Kalange](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohankalanje/) just seemed to be everywhere, everything all at once

</center>

he played crutial roles in like 10 - 20 clubs/teams on campus... the more important question would have been "what did Rohan not do"

and this man really used google calander - i mean he was late all the time but umm well he still get a lot of stuff done and more importantly both of us had very similar definitions for productivity - he'd consider doomscrolling for like 2hrs productive as long as it was something he wanted/planned to do

most people would define productivity as "doing the right stuff that would get you the most outcomes"

i have always had a different definition

> productivity to me was just doing what you wanted to get done in the first place

this concept is also something that Ali Abdaal talks in his book [Feel Good Productivity](https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/) and my all time favorite self-help author - Cal Newport talks about in his book [Slow Priductivity](https://calnewport.com/my-new-book-slow-productivity/)
