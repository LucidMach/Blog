## Introduction

So like most 2020 developers I used to give 0 fucks about bundlers...

I mean **react/next/svelte takes care of it** for us right

but then, I started doing this course called [threejs journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) by [brunosimon](https://bruno-simon.com/) in which bruno makes us understand why bundlers are important

TL;DR helps client import node_modules files that are stored on the server

## WebPack

The world's most popular javascript bundler "webpack" has a bunch of disadvantages

1. It is pretty **complex**, for context and it took me 2 days to understand and be able to configure webpack on my own
2. It is kinda really **slow** cuz it rebuilds and rebundles the files for every change
   _[especially if you want to use typescript]_

### Here's Recordings of WebPack

Time to Initial Load: **35s**

Time to Load Changes: **20s**

## Enter Snowpack

Snowpackjs has a fundamentally different approach to bundling...
It builds each file and caches it for future use, while webpack rebuilds and rebundles every single time

### Bonus

Snowpack is _**super easy** to configure_
here's the config I used in the below test

```
module.exports = {
  mount: {
    src: { url: "/" },
    public: { url: "/", static: true },
  },
};
```

it mounts files in src, public dir to "/" (root directory of served content)
